# Led-Picture-Frame
Open Source DIY Led Picture Frame 


Hey there,
This is a project, that I made for a friend for her birthday. 
It is basically a picture Frame with 88 Leds, 35 for Background Lighting, 52 for the actual picture Lighting.
The project is using WS2812b leds and a wemos d1 mini, as well as a usb c port for power supply.

Vibe Coded in Arduino, because my time was very short to build the project, but I still code Arduino manually.

Feel free to contribute, download, build :)

Noel
